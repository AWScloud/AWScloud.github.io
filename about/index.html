	<h1>Hi there, I am Makovec and here is something about me</h1>	
</div>

<p>I work as cloud architect in the company which is the leader in cloud consultancy business in the
Czech Republic. We do mostly Microsoft technologies which means Azure.<p/>

<p>For me cloud is not just Azure so I do also AWS. My main goal is to help clients with cloud automation. I am 
<a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/4039937?fullName=David%20%20Moravec">PowerShell MVP</a>, 
which means that I love scripting and automation. I worked in internal IT at Ernst &amp; Young 
as Configuration Manager administrator so this space is my other love.</p>

<p>To combine all of there - <i>Infrastructure as Code</i> is the space where I want to be now.</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/">this</a> 
and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcse-cloud-platform-infrastructure.aspx">this</a> 
cloud certifications.</p>
