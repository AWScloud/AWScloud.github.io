# Learning path to AWS Architect - part 1
Based on the learning path I found in document [APN Partner Learning Path](https://d0.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/partner-training/AWS_APN_Learning_Plan_2015_web.pdf) I decided to go first with [AWS Technical Professional](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/training/accreditation/#AWS_Technical_Professional) web based training.

It contains five modules:

 * Module 1: Overview of Amazon Web Services
 * Module 2: AWS Core Services
 * Module 3: AWS Architecture and Solutions (Part 1)
 * Module 4: AWS Architecture and Solutions (Part 2)
 * Module 5: Security and Compliance

If you have no idea about cloud computing in general it could give you nice overview ported to AWS platform. For me (as I know Microsoft Azure) it was good for checking (assigning) AWS names to already know services.

At the end of the sessions there was a test where you need to go for at least 80% of correct answers to pass the test. I succeeded so can now jump to the net recommended web based training.
