After some preparation, I finally decided to go to
 [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam.

Was a bit nervy as I heard that it's not easy, but I passed it :)

[This](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/transcript.aspx?transcript=F7DXEGQCKJ111EKY) is my transcript.
