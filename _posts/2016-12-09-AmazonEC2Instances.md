Today I was looking to comparison of Azure and Amazon virtual machine sizes. I found really handy table at [EC2Instances.info ](http://www.ec2instances.info/).

Of course - full comparison with description is available at [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) page.
