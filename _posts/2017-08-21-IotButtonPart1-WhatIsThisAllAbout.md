When I started to learn to my AWS exam, I saw [Amazon IoT Button](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-AWS-IoT-Button-Generation/dp/B01KW6YCIM). It was really nice, but at that time
it was possible to let it send only to US. After passing the exam I accidentaly found out that the same
button (now in 2nd generation) is available also at [Amazon.de](www.amazon.de). 

The only differency is the price: $19.95 at [.COM](https://www.amazon.com/All-New-AWS-IoT-Button-Generation/dp/B01KW6YCIM), €24.99 at [.DE](https://www.amazon.de/AWS-IoT-Button-2-Generation/dp/B0727NW8HT) That's the price for EU market. With shipping, the final price was €32.96.

## THE Button

Originally, Dash Buttons were used to order specific item as you can see [here](https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Buttons/b/ref=sv_devicesubnav_4?ie=UTF8&node=10667898011). At the moment there is a lot of different versions, even [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0719C1FKK), [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0187TN2FA), [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C3JA5SM) or even [this](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-JK29LP-Trojan-Dash-Button/dp/B01C3JBA7M).

IoT version is good for testing/playing with/working with Amazon AWS cloud technologies. As the name said: IoT.

## My mission

I wanted to use it for testing communication, to understand different AWS technologies and to have fun.

As the button has three possible "clicks" - single, double and long - it is possible to use it for three different actions. In this articles I am going to show how I set it up and how it works for me now.

I found a lot of articles, but unfortunately none of them was 100% accurate. Therefore I think that my articles will not be accurate tomorrow. But at least it hopefully help someone a bit.
